/* Graphical bongocat animation, driven by key press timer or WPM.
   It has left and right aligned cats optimized for both OLEDs.
   This code uses run-length encoded frames that saves space by
   storing frames of consecutively repeated bytes encoded in
   "byte,count" format.

   Inspired by @j-inc's bongocat animation code
   (keyboards/kyria/keymaps/j-inc)

   Cat images courtesy of @plandevida

   RLE code is modified from @vectorstorm's Bongocat:
   (https://github.com/vectorstorm/qmk_firmware/tree/new_vectorstorm_bongo/keyboards/crkbd/keymaps/vectorstorm)


   Usage guide
   1 Place this file next to keymap.c or in userspace.
   2 Add the following lines into rules.mk:
        OLED_ENABLE = yes
        SRC += oled-bongocat.c
   3 Left and right aligned Bongocat is default. To save space:
      * Add 'OPT_DEFS += -DLEFTCAT' into rules.mk
      * Or 'OPT_DEFS += -DRIGHTCAT' into rules.mk
   4 To animate with WPM, add 'WPM_ENABLE = yes' into rules.mk.
     Otherwise add the following integer variable and 'if'
     statement inside 'process_record_user()' in keymap.c:
        uint32_t tap_timer = 0;
        bool process_record_user(uint16_t keycode, keyrecord_t *record) {
            if (record->event.pressed) { tap_timer = timer_read32(); }
        }
   5 The 'oled_task_user()' calls 'render_mod_status()' for secondary OLED.
     It can be replaced with your own function, or delete the 'else' line.
