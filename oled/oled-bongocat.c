/* Graphical bongocat animation
   It has left and right aligned cats optimized for both OLEDs.
   This code uses run-length encoded frames that saves space by
   encoding frames into repeated or unique byte count.

   RLE code is modified from @vectorstorm's Bongocat:
   (https://github.com/vectorstorm/qmk_firmware/tree/bongo_rle/keyboards/crkbd/keymaps/vectorstorm)

   Inspired by @j-inc's bongocat animation code
   (keyboards/kyria/keymaps/j-inc)

   Cat images courtesy of @plandevida

   Usage guide
   1 Place this file next to keymap.c or in userspace.
   2 Add the following lines into rules.mk:
        OLED_ENABLE = yes
        SRC += oled-bongocat.c
   3 The 'oled_task_user()' calls 'render_mod_status()' from "oled-icons.c"
     for secondary OLED. Review that file for usage guide or replace
	 'render_mod_status()' with your own function.
